# How to install/run:

## Frontend:
`cd static && npm i` will install the frontend dependencies.

Inside the `static` folder
`npm run watch` will run an auto reloading server,
`npm run build` will build the project,
`npm run clean` will remove the dist folder,
`npm run test` will run the frontend tests

## Backend
`pip install -r requirements.txt` will install backend requirements,
`python app.py` will run the server (will launch on port 5000)

You will need `config.py` and `config.yaml` in the root directory of this folder

Please ask for these files if you don't have them and feel free to ask any questions
